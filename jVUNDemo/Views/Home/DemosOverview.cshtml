<h3>Demos Overview</h3>

<p>The demos show working examples of how to use jQuery.Validate.Unobtrusive.Native's HTML Helpers to generate form elements. These form elements have data attributes in place that work with jQuery Validation.  Each demo features the following:</p>

<ol>
    <li>A working demo so you can see the validation in action.  To trigger the validation on a demo then just click on the Submit button.  When / if all the validations have passed and the form submitted then the user will be presented with a message confirming that the form is valid.</li>
    <li>The Model being used to drive the validatation</li>
    <li>The View that takes the model and uses the HTML Helpers to generate form elements</li>
    <li>The HTML generated by the view</li>
</ol>
  
<p>All the demos rely upon both jQuery and the jQuery validation plug-in (which must be at least v1.11.0).</p>
