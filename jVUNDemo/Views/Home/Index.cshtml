<h3>What is jQuery.Validation.Unobtrusive.Native?</h3>

<p>jQuery.Validation.Unobtrusive.Native is a collection of ASP.Net MVC HTML helper extensions. These make use of jQuery Validation's native support for validation driven by HTML 5 data attributes.  Microsoft shipped <a href="http://bradwilson.typepad.com/blog/2010/10/mvc3-unobtrusive-validation.html" target="_blank">jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js</a> back with MVC 3.  It provided a way to apply data model validations to the client side using a combination of jQuery Validation and HTML 5 data attributes (that's the "unobtrusive" part).</p>

<p>The principal of this was and is fantastic.  But since that time the jQuery Validation project has implemented its own support for driving validation unobtrusively (this shipped with <a href="http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/changelog.txt" target="_blank">jQuery Validation 1.11.0</a>.  The advantages of the native support over jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Dynamically created form elements are parsed automatically.  jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js does not support this.</li>
    <li>jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js restricts how you use jQuery Validation.  Want to use showErrors etc?  Well you'll need to go native... </li>
    <li>Send less code to your browser, make your browser to do less work, get a performance benefit (though you'd probably have to be the Flash to actually notice the difference)</li>
</ul>

<p>This project intends to be a bridge between MVC's inbuilt support for driving validation from data attributes and jQuery Validation's native support for the same.  This is achieved by mapping the data attributes created by MVC over to the data attributes used by jQuery Validation.</p>

<h4>Future Plans</h4>

<p>At the moment the full set of the HtmlHelpers and their associated unobtrusive mappings have not yet been implemented (TextArea and ListBox are missing for instance).  As time goes by I intend to fill in the missing gaps, improve my unit test coverage and create some really useful documentation. Help is appreciated so feel free to pitch in!</p>
